# Original README

Earlier this year (2017) I was asked if there’s a good way to compare
developing web UIs in Google Web Toolkit (GWT) vs. Dart, specifically
AngularDart. Having worked with both GWT and Dart, I had a good idea
of the differences, but as I thought more, I started to wonder how hard
it would be to migrate a GWT application to AngularDart.

The GWT Mail Sample was an ideal place to start: it’s much more
than a trivial example, with diverse features and complex UI
interactions, yet it’s still manageable in size.
